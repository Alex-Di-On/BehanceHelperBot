### BehanceHelperBot

Hi! This is my first education Python project!

BehanceHelper is Bot, who help you to find Behance statistics of any author, who has a portfolio on this platform:

- Project Views
- Appreciations
- Followers
- Following
- Country

Also, this Bot remembers all your request history and you can see it at any time. Bot uses Database for keeping your request history. 


### Tech

BehanceHelperBot works on POST-request only by TelegramAPI.

In this project I've used next modules:

- requests
- sys
- time
- json
- bs4
- mysql.connector
- smtplib 
- email
- emoji
